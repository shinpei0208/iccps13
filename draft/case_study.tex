\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:case_study}

In this section, we provide a case study of magnetic control of
perturbed plasma equilibria using the HBT-EP ``Tokamak'' equiped with
the GPU and the presented I/O processing schemes.
This control system requires low latency and high computing capabilities
to achieve a sampling period of the order of ten microsenconds, while
processing 96 inputs and 64 outputs of 16-bit data with a complex
algorithm.
As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}, the CPU implementation
of this algorithm has never met the requirement of computing power.
The case study presented herein, therefore, is signicant in that we look
into a possibility of GPU implementations for the plasma control system.

Figure~\ref{fig:tokamak_sysarch} shows a system architecture used in
this case study.
The control input comes from a set of magnetic sensors through the
D-TACQ ACQ196 digitizer, and the resulting control signal is pulled by
two D-TACQ AO32 analog output modules to excite control coils.
These input and output module devices are connected to the GPU via the
PCIe bus.
We demonstrate that our zero-copy I/O processing scheme reduces both
the algorithm cycle time and the data transfer latency of feedback
control under this system architecture.

The cycle time and the latency of this feedback control system are shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:eval_plasma}.
