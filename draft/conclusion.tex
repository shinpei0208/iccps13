\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a new approach to zero-copy I/O
processing schemes for low-latency GPU computing.
This is a significant contribution to meet a real-time and real-fast
requirement of CPS.
The plasma control system, developed as an example application of CPS,
demonstrated that our zero-copy I/O processing scheme achieved a very
high rate of $16\mu$s for full plasma control processing.
Our microbenchmarking evaluation also disclosed the detailed properties
of I/O processing schemes for the GPU.
We believe that the contribution of this paper facilitates a grander
vision of CPS using parallel computing technology.

%In future work, we extend our schemes to support multiple contexts.
%This extension is essential to control multiple plants using the
%identical GPU.
%A key challenge is to ensure exclusive direct access to the same memory
%space, because the device driver and the runtime system cannot
%intermidiate in zero-copy I/O processing.
%We also plan to generalize our schemes for arbitrary I/O devices such as
%ethernet and firewire interfaces.
