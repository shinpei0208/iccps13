\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a new approach to GPU acceleration of
low-latency CPS applications.
This approach uses mapping of the device memory and the PCIe BAR
region, and configures I/O devices to transfer data to and from the
corresponding PCIe address space instead of the host main memory buffer
space.
The plasma control system, developed as an example of CPS applications,
demonstrated that the presented zero-copy I/O processing scheme achieved
a very high rate of $16\mu$s for full plasma control processing.
The additional microbenchmarking evaluation also clarified an advantage
of zero-copy I/O processing among those currently implementable for GPU
computing. 
We believe that the contribution of this paper would facilitate a
grander vision of CPS using heterogeneous compute devices as well as
GPUs.

In future work, we extend the zero-copy I/O processing scheme for
multiple contexts.
This extension is essential in a sense that we can control multiple
plants with a single GPU.
A key challenge is to ensure exclusive direct access to the same memory
space; device drivers and runtime libraries are not able intermediate
during DMA transfers.
We also plan to apply the same zero-copy scheme to arbitrary I/O devices
such as Ethernet and Firewire.
